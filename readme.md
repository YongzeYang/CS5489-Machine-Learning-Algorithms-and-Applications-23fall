## Introduction

This course is a  postgraduate level course offered by the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), and is a required course for PhD and MPhil students in the CS department, as well as an elective course for taught postgraduate students.

I took this course in the 23fall semester, and this repository will contain the code and reports for the Tutorials, Assignments, and Project that I completed in this course, which are completed by myself (and my group members) , instead of standard answers. In addition, I will upload some previous midterm and final exam papers for revision purposes.

All the tutorials and assignments in this class are well prepared, and you can learn and benefit *a lot* from this class.

## Content introduction and index

### Tutorials

At the end of each lecture there will be a Tutorial session related to this course. Reference answers for all tutorials will be given for revision before the exam. For Tutorials, only one single Jupyter file is required to be submitted. The location of the 10 Tutorials is given below:

| Tutorials                                 | Location                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [Tutorial 1](Tutorials/Tutorial1.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial1.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 2](Tutorials/Tutorial2.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial2.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 3](Tutorials/Tutorial3.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial3.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 4](Tutorials/Tutorial4.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial4.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 5](Tutorials/Tutorial5.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial5.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 6](Tutorials/Tutorial6.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial6.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 7](Tutorials/Tutorial7.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial7.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 8](Tutorials/Tutorial8.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial8.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 9](Tutorials/Tutorial9.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial9.ipynb |
| [Tutorial 10](Tutorials/Tutorial10.ipynb) | Tutorials/Tutorial10.ipynb |

I deducted 1 point each for tutorial 2 and tutorial 6, and the rest of the tutorials were full marks.

### Assignments

Each Assignment will be given a specific machine learning scenario (typically, Assignment 1 is a text classification problem and Assignment 2 is an audio classification problem), and you will need to write your own solution given the background conditions and limited guidelines, and predict the unlabeled testing dataset based on a small amount of training data, and submit the result csv to the course Kaggle.

You need to submit three files, including a csv file of the final result, a Jupyter file that generates this csv file (to verify that this csv result is reproducible), and a full Jupyter report (which needs to document all attempts made to generate the final result).

The locations of the two Assignments I completed are listed below:

| Content                          | Location                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Assignment 1                     | Assignment 1                                |
| Assignment 1 Report              | Assignment 1/Assignment1-2023A-report.ipynb |
| Assignment 1 Final Solution      | Assignment 1/Assignment1-2023A-Final.ipynb  |
| Assignment 1 Prediction Result   | Assignment 1/final_submission.csv           |
| Assignment 2                     | Assignment 2                                |
| Assignment 2 Report              | Assignment 2/Assignment2-2023A-report.ipynb |
| Assignment 2 Final Solution      | Assignment 2/Assignment2-2023A-Final.ipynb  |
| Assignment 2 Prediction Result   | Assignment 2/final_submission.csv           |

I deducted 2 points for Assignment 1 (1 point because the report discussion was not insightful enough and 1 point because the kaggle ranking was outside the 1%) and 0.5 points for Assignment 2 (because the kaggle ranking was not within the 0.5%).

## Group Project

For the Group Project, you can choose to team up with another student to complete it. The content of the Project is similar to the Assignment. The topic is open and you can either choose from any of the given existing Kaggle competitions or you can pick a topic of your own to complete.

The topic we chose at the time was [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text) and all our efforts are located in the catalog under `Group Project`, you can read our report at `Group Project/Course Project-2023A.ipynb`.

## Past Exam Papers

In 23fall, the midterm exam for this course will cover the first five chapters and the final exam will cover the last five chapters. The exams are all closed book, but one-page (midterm) or double-page(final exam) handwritten A4 cheatsheet is allowed during the exams.

Currently, there are 5 sets of midterm exam papers, they all contain questions and answers and you can view them in `Past Exam Papers\Midterms`. In addition, there are 2 sets of final exam papers, but they only have questions and no answers, you can view them at `Past Exam Papers\Finals`.

Note: Subsequent exam questions and content may change or take other forms.

## Other Useful Information

This course focuses on the practical application sessions of machine learning, covering all aspects of machine learning from A to Z, and the course workload is **heavy**. The lectures, tutorial exercises, assignments, and project for this course are all based on Jupyter Notebooks, and the CS department will provide an online Jupyter Lab (including GPU resources) for use. Of course, you can use your own computer to complete the assignments.

For the Fall 23 semester, the grade for this course will consist of the following:

| Session        | Percentage | Remarks                           |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Tutorials 1-10 | 10%        |                                   |
| Assignment 1   | 10%        |                                   |
| Assignment 2   | 10%        |                                   |
| Group Project  | 30%        | At least 30% to pass the course   |
| Midterm        | 10%        | Average score in 23fall: 49.2/100 |
| Final Exam     | 30%        | At least 30% to pass the course   |

You need to get at least 30% on the group project and the final exam to pass the course.
